## Network Access Methods

**IEEE 802.11b/g/n** is the most common wireless technology used in the world. It is used for connecting to the Internet. IEEE 802 is set of local ear network technical standards that specifies the set of media access control (MAC) and physical layer protocols for implementing wireless local area network.

**ADSL** is a type of digital subscriber line (DSL) technology that communicates faster data transmission over copper telephone lines.

**DOCSIS** is an international telecommunications standard that permits the addition of high-bandwidth data transfer to existing cable television system.

## Structure of the Internet

**Tier 1 ISP** is a network that can reach every other network on the internet solely via settlement-free interconnection. Tier 1 networks can exchange traffic with other Tier 1 networks without paying any fees for exchange of traffic. While Tier 2 and 3 networks must pay to transmit traffic on other networks.

**Access ISP** is an organization that provides services for accessing, using or paticipating in the internet. ISP can be organized in various forms such as commerical, community-owned, non-profit or otherwise privately owned. Services prodivded by ISPs can include Internet access, Internet transit, domain name registration, web hosting.

**IXP** is an internet exchange point in a physical location though which internet infrastructure companies such as ISP and CDNs connect with each other. These locations exist on the “edge” of different networks, and allow network providers to share transit outside their own network.
